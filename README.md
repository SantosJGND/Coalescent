## Current work on coalescent theory.

While the package ms provides excellent utilities for simulating samples
using coalescent theory, i have not yet encountered python modules for the more
aspects of coalescent theory. This repository attempts to fill that gap.

Be kind I did not look too deeply. Exploring coalescent theory in depth for the 
first time, would have tried my own implementations anyhow. As one should.
