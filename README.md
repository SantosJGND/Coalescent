## Current work on coalescent theory.

While the package ms provides excellent utilities for simulating samples
using coalescent theory, i have not yet encountered python modules for the more 
basic aspects of coalescent theory. This repository attempts to fill that gap.

Be kind I did not look too deeply. Exploring coalescent theory in depth for the 
first time, would have tried my own implementations anyhow. As one should.

### I. Probability of data under Inifinite Alleles and Infinite Sites models.

Algorithms.

### II. Time and varying theta.

Application to rice data - preliminary.
